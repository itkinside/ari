Ari
===


What is it?
-----------

Ari is a controlling system for animations on a LED wall, specifically
developed to manage the LED wall in ``Bodegaen'' location of the student
society in Tronheim, Norway.

Hopefully, it may be possible to use the system for similar installations, like
the one at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the Norwegian
University of Science and Technology.
